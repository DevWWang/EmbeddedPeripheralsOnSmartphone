#### BLE connection and data exchange between STM32F4Disocvery board and Android App via a Nucleo board with BLE shield.

This project aimed at building the communication between the Discovery board and an Android phone via Bluetooth Low Energy connection that is supported by STM32F401RE Nucleo board with an IDB04A1 shield. More specifically, the Discovery board is responsible for measuring its temperature and its orientation. Also, it requires a double tap feature using the accelerometer in order to wake up the smart phone. On the other hand, user can control LEDs on the Discovery board, including the intensity (PWM), the speed of rotation, and the direction of rotation through the application on the Android device.
